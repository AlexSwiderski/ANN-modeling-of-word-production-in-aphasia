    "Anomia, impairment of the ability to access and retrieve words, is the hallmark deficit of people with aphasia (Goodglass & Wingfield, 1997). Prevailing cognitive models support the assumption that word retrieval involves semantic, lexical, and phonological processing (Dell, Schwartz, Martin, Saffran, & Gagnon, 1997; Foygel & Dell, 2000; Walker & Hickok, 2016). Confrontation picture naming tests (e.g., Druks & Masterson, 2000; German, 1990; Kaplan, Goodlgass, & Weintraub, 2001) are typically administered to assess anomia severity, build patients’ profiles, and quantify change after treatment. The Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) (Roach, Schwartz, Martin, Grewal, & Brecher, 1996) is a confrontation naming test that was developed in tandem with a series of computational models of word retrieval in persons with aphasia (Dell & O’Seaghdha, 1992; Dell et al., 1997; Foygel & Dell, 2000). It is made up of diverse stimuli varying in length, age of acquisition, and lexical frequency (Francis & Kucera, 1982), it has a well-defined scoring system for classifying anomic errors (Dell et al., 1997), and its total score correlates highly with aphasia severity (Walker & Schwartz, 2012).
